    "explanations": {
      "30": "Only 30 cm is 0.3 meters. You need to multiply by 100.",
      "3": "3 meters equals 300 cm, not just 3 cm.",
      "100": "That's just 1 meter. Multiply by 3: 3 * 100 = 300."

    "explanations": {
      "90°": "Only one right angle, not the whole triangle.",
      "270°": "Too much—sum for a triangle is always 180°.",

    "explanations": {
      "32 cm": "Incorrect—That would be the perimeter if sides were miscounted or doubled incorrectly.",
      "24 cm": "Correct—2 * (8 + 4) = 24 cm.",
      "20 cm": "Incorrect—Misses one side, perhaps only added one length and one width.",
